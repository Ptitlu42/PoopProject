# 🚽 Daily POOP SMS Service 💩

## Overview 📱
This service is designed to send a 💩 poop SMS message every day to a list of subscribers. Each message is randomly selected from a predefined list of poop-themed quotes. Additionally, an image is attached to the SMS, which is generated by an artificial intelligence (AI) 🤖 based on the content of the message. The final SMS includes the chosen message and the AI-generated poop masterpiece.
